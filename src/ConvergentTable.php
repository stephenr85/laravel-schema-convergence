/**
 * A CONVERGENT migration guard: "ensure this table has this shape", in place of "create this table".
 *
 * ## The failure it exists to end
 *
 * `spatie/laravel-package-tools` stamps a published migration with `now()`; vendor packages ship
 * fixed-date copies. Two migrations creating the SAME table therefore race on filename, and because
 * both sides guard with a bare `Schema::hasTable($t) → return`, **whichever sorts first wins and the
 * loser's guard reports success** — `migrate:fresh` exits green having produced a schema the app cannot
 * use. Sighted three times across the beam-facade effort: lunarphp's `activity_log` and the bigint-vs-uuid
 * `roles.id` break (ticket 13), two `create_media_table`s (16/17), and the submissions fork (20/23).
 *
 * Convergence removes the race rather than arbitrating it. Whoever runs first creates; whoever runs
 * second tops up what is missing; filename order stops mattering. See
 * `docs/agents/convergent-migration-guards.convention.md` (in THIS package) for the rule and the
 * estate's obligations under it, and `splicewire/laravel-beam`'s
 * `docs/agents/migration-publish-ordering.convention.md` for the OTHER half of the collision family
 * (cross-package ALTER-vs-CREATE plus the installer's filename-order lever), which this does not
 * address and which stays in beam because the installer does.
 *
 * ## The three tiers
 *
 * | state                                        | verdict                  |
 * | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
 * | table absent                                 | create it                |
 * | table present, declared columns absent       | **add them** — converge  |
 * | table present, column present, wrong type    | **throw** — cannot converge |
 *
 * Tier three is the load-bearing one. Convergence handles ABSENCE, never CONFLICT, and both sightings
 * with proven damage were type conflicts: Lunar's `activity_log` does not LACK the morph columns, it has
 * them as bigint `nullableMorphs` where beam needs strings, so `hasColumns()` returns true and a
 * top-up-what-is-missing guard would top up nothing. {@see SchemaConflict} carries the two further
 * shapes convergence cannot reach — a NOT NULL addition to a populated table, and NOT NULL residue the
 * declaration does not know about (beam-facade ticket 23).
 *
 * **No DDL is written when a conflict is found.** A conflicted run leaves the table exactly as it was,
 * so the two terminals differ only in how loud they are, never in what they did.
 *
 * ## Two terminals, both required
 *
 * `->assert()` throws {@see SchemaConvergenceConflict}; `->matches()` returns a bool and stays quiet.
 * One terminal would force every call site into the other's shape — a stale-fork collision wants the
 * throw, while the shared-test-DB harness and "Lunar wins harmlessly in a host with no central audit
 * trail" want the quiet return.
 *
 * ```php
 * // the name may be a literal or computed — this package neither knows nor cares whose prefix it is
 * ConvergentTable::named('beam_ownership_edges')
 *     ->define(function (Blueprint $t) {
 *         $t->uuid('id')->primary();
 *         $t->uuid('owner_id');
 *         $t->timestamps();
 *     })
 *     ->assert();
 * ```
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * **Per-column type conversion** (`->change()`). Ruled out at beam-facade ticket 22 with a trigger: build
 * it when a real host must upgrade THROUGH a type conflict. Every sighting so far needed detection plus
 * someone told, not conversion — and designing a conversion API against zero call sites is the shape this
 * estate has refused twice. The extension point is `Macroable` plus {@see ConvergenceReport}, which names
 * the conflicting column: a host that must convert can macro one on without touching this class.
 *
 * **Foreign keys and primary keys on an EXISTING table.** The create path applies whatever the definition
 * declares; the converge path adds columns and plain/unique/full-text indexes only. A primary key cannot
 * be added after the fact on sqlite, and a foreign key added to a populated table fails on the rows that
 * are already there — both are deliberate migrations, not convergence.
 *
 * Homed here rather than in `laravel-beam/src/Schema/` since beam-facade ticket 34: the promotion
 * trigger fired for five `rushing/*` packages that publish a `create_*` and carry no beam dependency
 * at all. The standing rule that came with the move — any family package that publishes a `create_*`
 * guards it convergently, whatever its vendor and whether or not it depends on beam.
