/**
 * One reason a table cannot be converged onto the shape a migration declares — the third tier of
 * {@see ConvergentTable}'s verdict table, where "add the missing thing" is not available.
 *
 * Three kinds, and the distinction is not cosmetic: each names a DIFFERENT repair, and the whole
 * point of throwing rather than skipping is that a human is told which one.
 *
 * - `type` — the column exists with an incompatible database type. The damage class this utility
 *   exists to end: `hasColumns()` returns TRUE for it, so a bare existence guard converges nothing
 *   and reports success against a table the app cannot use (lunarphp's bigint `nullableMorphs`
 *   where beam's `activity_log` needs string morphs; the bigint-vs-uuid `roles.id` break).
 * - `required-addition` — a declared column is NOT NULL with no default and the table already holds
 *   rows, so the ALTER itself would fail. Convergence handles ABSENCE, not a populated table.
 * - `required-residue` — a column the declaration does not know about is NOT NULL with no default,
 *   so every canonical insert fails AFTER a textbook-clean convergence. Found on the submissions
 *   fork (beam-facade ticket 23), which is neither a missing-column nor a type case: the fork's own
 *   `schema_record_id` survives convergence and then rejects every write.
