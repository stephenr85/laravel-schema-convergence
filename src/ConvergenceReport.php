/**
 * What {@see ConvergentTable} found and what it did about it — the value both terminals are built on:
 * `assert()` throws when {@see hasConflicts()}, `matches()` returns its negation.
 *
 * Deliberately also readable on its own, because the interesting migrations are the ones that did
 * NOTHING: a table that already matched is indistinguishable at the database from a table this run
 * created, and a host chasing an install is entitled to know which happened.
 *
 * `unverified` is the conservative posture: a declared column type this build has no driver mapping for
 * is REPORTED, never guessed at and never escalated to a conflict. A false conflict stops an install; a
 * missed one is the status quo. (Inherited from the under-report-rather-than-mislead posture beam's
 * migration-ordering audit takes with a dynamically-named table — named as prose, not linked, because
 * this package must not know its consumers.)
