/**
 * Thrown by {@see ConvergentTable::assert()} when the live table cannot be converged onto the shape a
 * migration declares — tier three of the verdict table, where "add the missing thing" is unavailable.
 *
 * This is the noise the whole convergent-guard convention exists to make. The failure it replaces is
 * silent: two migrations create the same table, both guard with `hasTable`, whichever sorts first wins
 * and the loser's guard reports SUCCESS — so `migrate:fresh` exits green having produced a schema the
 * app cannot use, and only a seeder or a production write notices (beam-facade tickets 13, 16/17, 20).
 *
 * A conflict is therefore an install-time stop by design. The escape is {@see ConvergentTable::matches()},
 * the quiet terminal, for the call sites that genuinely do not care which shape won.
